                    <h2>BATTERY & PERFORMANCE</h2>
                    <p>P-1's market-leading 2 hours charging time from a normal house outlet and first-in-class 30 minutes DC Fast charging allows you to be more adventurous than ever and opens up new possibilities. With Yatri Energy’s strong national network of charging stations, P-1 will truly reflect the freedom of travel.  </p>
                    <p>A mixed riding style of mildly sporty and laidback city riding (40 kmph) gives P-1 a comfortable range of 110 km on a single rider (75 kg) setup. Depending on how laidback you are and your weight, you can expect a real-world city range of a figure slightly more or less than 110 km. You can expect slightly less range with a pillion rider.</p>
                    <p>While P-1 is a lot of fun when you push it or on the highways, it will demand more current from its powertrain which inevitably depletes the charge at a much higher rate. Depending on how adventurous you get, you may get a range as low as 60-70 km. This figure might go further down on a hilly off road trips. Additionally, pushing P-1 beyond normal use case will also increase the system temperature at a much higher rate triggering the P-1 system protection which results in a reduced power supply temporarily.</p>

                  <h2>ECONOMY OF USE</h2>
                  <p>How many kilometers do you add on your commute every day? How does that look at the end of your ownership period? P-1’s over 90% efficient powertrain will cost you barely NPR 0.3 per km while comparable combustion engine motorcycles will cost you well over 20 times of that. That opens a host of possible use case of P-1 besides your daily commute.</p>
